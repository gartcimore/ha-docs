install mushroom cards from HACS
https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom

install custom brand icons
https://github.com/elax46/custom-brand-icons

install Weather Chart Card
https://github.com/mlamberts78/weather-chart-card

for the mobile dashboard using mushrooms cards, in the entity card for the room add :
```yaml
{% if is_state('light.a_light_for_this_room', 'on') %}
  orange
{% endif %}
```

and add:
```yaml
#Showing the state of a temperature in a template card:
{{ states('sensor.a_temp_sensor') }}Â°C / {{ states('sensor.xxx_humidity_sensor')}} ðŸ’§
```

in the mushroom template card *Primary information*

add a unique name in the /Navigation path/

add Navigate action either as /Tap action/ or /Hold action/


add an helper called /lights_on/ using a template (to count ligts on)

State template :
```yaml
{{ states.light
  |selectattr('state','equalto','on')
  |list
  |length
}}
```

Check if today is Sunday
```yaml
{{ now().isoweekday() == 0 }}
```

and state class : Total
in the dashboard, add a chip card based on entity and select the helper created.

# custom sensor
